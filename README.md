## Description
This project is part of the milestone tasks aimed at improving Python programming skills and learning GitHub best practices. It focuses on:
- Working with Python data structures such as lists.
- Implementing conditional logic using `if` statements.
- Taking user input and validating it.
- Writing code collaboratively and documenting it for future reference.

The goal of the project is to create a Python program that randomly selects a word from a list, takes user input, and validates the input. This helps in building a foundational understanding of Python programming concepts.

### What I Learned
- How to use lists and the `random.choice()` method.
- Taking and validating user input with Python's `input()` function.
- Using Git for version control and documenting a project using GitHub's README file.
